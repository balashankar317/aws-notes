How many types of applications are there?
We can classify the applications broadly into 4 categories/types:

3. Mobile Applications
4. Batch Processing Systems



1. Standalone/Desktop/Thick-client Applications
These are the applications that are installed / executed locally on the computer system on which those are running. These applications are also called as "single-user applications", since at anypoint of time only one user can use them.
These applications generates and stores the data locally on the computer system storage where those are running.
