FileSystem Management Commands
-------------------------------
FileSystem management commands are related to creating and managing the files/directories on the Filesystem of the Linux operating system computer.
	
What is a File?
File is an logical entity/unit often referred with a name, and is used for storing data on the FileSystem of the computer permanently.
	
What is a Folder/Directory?
Folder or Directory is used for grouping related files/folders into them for organizing and quickly locating/accessing them on the FileSystem of the computer.
	
1. How to create an empty file?
touch filename
touch is used for creating an empty file on the Filesystem of the linux machine

2. How to see the list of files/folders on the Filesystem?
ls = list files and folders

ls -l = long list of files and folders
it shows the info of the files/folders in the below tabular format

total 0
drwxr-xr-x  2 sriman  staff  64 Oct  1 08:02 housedocs
-rw-r--r--  1 sriman  staff   0 Oct  1 08:00 powerbill.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 sriman  staff   0 Oct  1 08:00 waterbill.txt

2.1 The first character tells you the listed entry is a file or folder
- = regular file
d = directory

2.2 File Permissions
The next 9 characters indicates the permissions given for a file/folder to 3 different groups of users who are
	- owner
	- group
	- others
here r = read, w = write, x = execute permissions

3. How to create a directory/folder?
mkdir foldername

4. How to print a text message onto the Console/Terminal?
echo message
	
5. 	How to create file along with some data inside it?
in Linux we have redirection operators for both input and output redirection.
	
Every linux command by default takes the data as an input from keyboard/STDIN and writes the data onto the STDOUT/console/Monitor. If we want to redirect the Input from where it is taking or output it is writing then we need to use Input/Output redirection operators.
	
> = output redirection
< = input redirection

>> = output redirection by appending.
	
echo "Good Evening! have a good rest of your day" > filename
the above echo command by default writes the output onto the Console, instead of writing onto the Console we are redirecting the output using ">" operator into a file by specifying the filename.
	
Filename passed is already existing file, the it replaces the contents of it with the given message to the echo. If the file doesnt exists it creates an new file

6. How to see the contents of an file?
cat filename
cat is the command used for seeing the contents inside the file

7. How to move the files or folders into a different location?
mv sourceFile destinationPath/
mv -r sourceDirectory destinationPath = here -r stands for recursive which means mv all the files and folders inside the source directory along with source

8. How to copy the files or folders?
cp sourceFile to destinationPath/
if the destination you specified is not an directory then it copies the contents of the file into a new file by creating one more

9. how to change into another directory?
cd directoryName
cd .. = goto parent directory
cd / = takes to root of the filesystem
cd = takes the user to user home directory
cd ~ = goes to userhome directory
cd - = takes back to the previous directory where user has came from


10. How to see the present working directory?
pwd  = print working directory

11. How to remove a file or folder?
rm filename
rm -r directoryname = here -r stands for recursively delete all the files/folders inside the given directory
