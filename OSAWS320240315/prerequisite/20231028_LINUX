Pipes and Redirectors

Pipes are used for joining multiple linux commands in creating new commands
Redirectors are used for redirecting the stdout or stdin of a linux command

Redirectors
-----------
every linux command by default takes the input from stdin (keyboard) and writes/prints/generates the output on to stdout (console/monitor). So if we want to let the linux command write the output onto an different destination rather than stdout or read the data from different source rather than stdin then we need to use redirectors

There are 2 redirector operators provided by linux bash
 > = to redirect the output of an linux command
 < = to redirect the input of an linux command

example on output redirection:
echo "Good Morning!" = echo prints the message onto stdout (console), instead of generating the output onto console, we can ask echo command to write the output onto a file using output redirector operator as below

echo "Good Morning" > message.txt

example on input redirection:
cat message.txt

cat > message.txt

Pipes
-----
Pipes are used for writing the output of one command as an input into another command in linux. To write the output of a command as an input to another command we need to use pipe operator provided by bash as "|"

file2.txt
Good Morning, Welcome to pipes and redirector operators

now we want to count in above file how many words, characters and lines exists this can be done using wc (word count) as below

cat file2.txt | wc -l (or -c) (or -w)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
find and grep
-------------
1. find
find is used for searching for files with given name or pattern within the directory

syntax:
find directory/ -name "filename" -print

2. grep
grep is used for searching in contents of the files

meetings.txt
1  daily standup  10:00 am
2  workout session 8:00 am
3  lunch with leadership 12:30 pm
4  design discussions    1:45 pm

grep "daily" meetings.txt
grep is mostly used for searching for the contents in the log files
