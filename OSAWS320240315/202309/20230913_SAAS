on-demand delivery of computing resources/services to the world is called "cloud computing". They offer #3 types of services
1. IAAS
2. PAAS
3. SAAS

2. PAAS
Platform as a Service. all the required platform software packages/libraries that are required for running the enduser applications are managed and provided by cloud provider itself.
	
There are lot of advantages of using PAAS from cloud provider:
1. Along with provisioning the infrastructure, the PAAS layer/software also will be installed and configured by the cloud provider itself. So that the infrastructure provisioned by the cloud platform is ready for use.
	
2. upgrading & patching the PAAS layer is taken care by the cloud providers, we dont need to apply or takecare of these things manually.
	
3. backup & restore will be not be applied on IAAS along with that PAAS also will be taken care by cloud provider

4. All the cloud lifecycle operations like scale-out/scale-in, scale-up/scale-down, start, stop, restart will be applied on PAAS aswell along with IAAS

Now the business organization has to only takecare of running or hosting their applications without worried about maintaining the Infrastructure/Platform software.
