Networking
The core or the main domain within the AWS Domains is networking. Unless we understand networking domain we cannot learn other services/domains of the AWS Cloud platform.
	
But inorder to learn the Networking domain, upon setting an network, we need to have an resource created on the network to verify the network we have setup is working properly or not by accessing the resource on the network.
	
So before learning the Networking domain and the services of Networking domain, we need to understand a basic resource which is ec2 instance and how to provision and access it on the AWS Cloud Platform.

How to provision an ec2 instance on AWS Cloud Platform?
EC2 Instance
EC2 stands for elastic cloud compute, it is nothing but an computer/machine created by aws cloud platform.
