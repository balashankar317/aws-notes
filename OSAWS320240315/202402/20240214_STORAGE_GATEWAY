Storage Gateway
----------------
Storage gateway offers hybrid-model of running on-premise applications on the cloud platform. if our applications are designed and coded to work on on-premise infrastructure, moving them onto the aws cloudplatform is going to be difficult. We need to
1. rewrite the application program/code to use aws sdks or apis to persist the data onto the cloud services
2. We need to recreate equivalent cloud infrastructure inorder to move the applications from datacenter to the cloud
3. move all the data from on-premise to the cloud

rewriting the applications involves re-development of the existing applications and cost involved in re-developing and re-deplying them would be very high and we cannot move all the applications overnight onto the cloud.
Then how to run and bridge the applications which are running on on-premise and cloud parallely, that is where storage gateway is being used.
	
By using the storage gateway, the existing applications which are running on on-premise servers doesnt need to be rewritten, rather through the help of storage gateway, they can push the application data generated on the on-premise to the aws cloud platform. So that the applications which are running on on-premise and cloud both uses the same storage/data to run. Over the time we can migrate the whole bunch of applications to the cloud and can demolish the on-premise infrastructure

There are 3 types of storage gateways are there
1. volume gateway
2. tape gateway
3. file gateway
