compute domain
There are 5 services are provided aspart of the compute domain
1. elastic compute cloud (ec2)
2. elastic loadbalancer
3. elastic beanstalk
4. autoscaling group (asg)
5. lambda
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Elastic Loadbalancer
To understand the loadbalancer, let us explore how does the application is hosted/deployed and exposed to the public world

To host/deploy an application and expose it to the public world we need
1. compute instance [computer/server-grade machine]
2. programming language (java, .net, python, php etc) using which we build the software application
3. based on the programming language we choose, we need to use an appropriate dynamic webserver of the language to deploy and host the application
	3.1 java web application = tomcat (or) jetty (or) netty (or) weblogic server (or) websphere server etc
	3.2 .net application = iis server
	3.3 python application = flask server
	3.3 php = lamp server
	etc
4. we need to deploy the application on the respective server to host it

networking and infrastructure:
1. static ip address
2. the machine should be connected to the public network
3. register domain routing the request to the ipaddress of the machine through dns entry

application topology: based on the way the application is hosted and exposed to world, we call it as topology of the application
