vpc peering
-----------
vpc peering allows the resources across the vpcs to communicate with each other

why cant we enable the resources across the vpcs to communicate with each other by exposing them through public subnets?
There are dis-advantages as below:
1. if we make the subnets as public subnets to enable communication between the resources across the vpcs, then the resource would be made available over external network as well
2. the resources across these vpc subnets has to always communicate over the public network channel (thru internet gateway) due to which
	2.1 the network latency in enabling the communication is very high
	2.2 the bandwidth consumption would be very high that results in more cost

instead we can have these 2 vpcs peered with each other so that all the communicate across these vpcs takes place through aws cloud network itself, thus reducing the network latency and cost

vpc peering limitations/restrictions:
1. The ip ranges of the 2 vpc networks should not be overlapping
2. transitive routing is not supported. VPCA -> VPCB, VPCB -> VPCC we have peering connection, it doesnt mean the resources of VPCA can communicate with VPCC, to have the traffic flow between VPCA -> VPCC we need to establish one more peering connection between them
3. There can be at max only one active peering connection between 2 vpcs. For eg.. VPCA -> VPCB has a active peering connection, we cannot create one more between them
4. There is an quote limitation on number of peering active and pending connections per vpc
	active connections per vpc: 50 (softlimit: max 125)
	pending peering connection requests: 25
	expiry time for an unaccepted peering connection request: 1 week
5. edge routing is not supported
if VPCA has an internet gateway or NAT device, the resources of VPCB cant use the gateway in VPCA to access the internet
6. You cannot create an security group rule that refers to peer vpc security group
